Hello, I'm Jaydip! I'm an Expert Full Stack Web Developer with 4+ years of experience in web development, and I am eager to learn even more technologies to sharpen my skillset. I work exclusively with the Laravel framework, and I love it.


I've created many projects from scratch and have great experience working in a big team of developers on large projects. I can get started quickly and get things done right away. I always strive to deliver top-notch quality work, and I'm always excited to work on a cool project!

I have a lot of experience with a bunch of things:

✔ PHP (Laravel framework)

✔ SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL)

✔ NoSQL (MongoDB)

✔ JS (jQuery, Vue, Laravel Mix)

✔ HTML and CSS (Bootstrap, SASS, BEM)

✔ Git (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab)

✔ Linux server administration

✔ UX/UI (I've created many projects from scratch and know how to create great UI & UX)

✔ Project management (Jira, Trello, Asana)

✔ Integration with 3rd party services and APIs



A few things about me:
- I am passionate about solving problems and getting things done
- I love to write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- I have excellent attention to detail, and I always make sure to cover all corner cases
- I have almost 24/7 online and respond very quickly
- I prefer long-term projects

Feel free to ask me anything.
